# Project Architecture: Agentic-RAG-Challenge

> Note: This document is the single source of truth for the project's logic, design, and behavior. It describes what we are building and how it works logically.
> 

---

## 1. Project Idea & Philosophy

> Context: Describe the core essence, need, and vision of the project. What problem does it solve? Why does it exist?
> 

[Example: "The project is an Agentic LLM Evaluation tool. The core need is to automate the tedious process of benchmarking different LLMs against specific business tasks using a multi-agent approach. The philosophy is 'Agent-driven Quality Assurance'."]

---

## 2. Project Body (Form Factor)

> Context: In what form will the project be realized?
> 
- **Type:** [e.g., CLI Application / Python Script / Web Service / Telegram Bot]
- **Interface:** [e.g., Terminal interaction via arguments / REST API / Interactive Chat]

---

## 3. User Workflow (Operational Principle)

> Context: A step-by-step narrative of how the user interacts with the finished product. This defines the flow of the application.
> 

[Example Step-by-Step Description:

1. **User Action:** User inputs a command (e.g., `/start_eval`).
    - **System Reaction:** The system initializes the `TaskAnalyst` agent.
    - **Outcome:** A specification file is generated.
2. **User Action:** User reviews the spec and inputs `/generate_dataset`.
    - **System Reaction:** The system initializes the `DatasetSpecialist` agent.
    - **Outcome:** A JSON dataset is created or fetched.
3. ... (Continue describing the flow)

## 4. Technology Decisions

> Context: The chosen stack, libraries, and tools.
> 
- **Language:** [e.g., Python 3.11]
- **Core Libraries:** [e.g., LangChain, Pydantic, Typer]
- **Storage:** [e.g., Local JSON files, SQLite]

---

## 5. Component Design

> Context: Description of the logical modules (Classes/Files) within the src/ folder. Do not use physical blocks; use logical separation (Classes, Interfaces).
### A
...

### B
...

### C
...

> 
- **[Component/Class Name 1]**
    - **Responsibility:** [What does this class do?]
    - **Key Methods:** [e.g., `analyze_task()`, `generate_report()`]
    - **Interactions:** [Which other components does it call?]
- **[Component/Class Name 2]**
    - **Responsibility:** ...

---

## 6. Code Organization Pattern

> The mandatory file and code structure within the src/ directory. This pattern promotes a clear separation of concerns.
> 

[Example:

- `main.py`: **The Entrypoint & Orchestrator.** This is the only file that should be directly executed. It is responsible for parsing command-line arguments, initializing services, and coordinating the overall application flow. It should contain minimal business logic.
- `config.py`: **Configuration.** Stores all static configuration, constants, file paths (e.g., `DATABASE_FILE = "tasks.json"`), and settings.
- `utils/`: **Utilities Directory.** Contains specific, reusable helper functions that are not part of the core business logic.
    - Example: `parser.py` for validating user input, or `formatter.py` for creating styled console output.

## 7. Core Data Models (Optional)(If implied in the project)

> A brief description of the main data entities.
> 

[Example:

- **[Model 1: e.g., Task]**
- **Purpose:** Represents a single to-do item with an ID, title, and completion status. Will be modeled as a Pydantic class.

]

## 8. Key Conventions & Logging

- **Modularity:** Code must be logically separated into classes and modules within `src/`.
- **Logging:** All significant events must be logged to `logs/`.
    - **Format:** `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [LEVEL] - Message`
- **Tools:** Reusable scripts created during development should be saved in `tools/`.
